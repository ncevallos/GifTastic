# GifTastic


### General App Functionality

The Gif Tastic App allows a user to search for Gifs in the Giphy database, by entering a topic into the text box. Once the user submits the topic, the topic then becomes a click-able button. Upon clicking on a topic button, Gifs from Giphy then populate the page, that are the results of the searched topic. The Gifs on the page also have a clickable feature to them, in where they animate/run when clicked, and then stop running and return to a still image upon being clicked a second time.

### App Technical Functionality

The Gif Tastic App was created to utlize the GIPHY API, and created a broswer based search, for Gifs, based on whatever keywords that a user enters. Technologies used to create this app include, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AJAX calls, and JQuery.
